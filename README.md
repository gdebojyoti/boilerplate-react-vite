# Boilerplate: React + Vite

The base template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. I have made the following updates on top of it -
- [x] React & ReactDOM updated to v19
- [x] React Router v7 added to support pages

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
